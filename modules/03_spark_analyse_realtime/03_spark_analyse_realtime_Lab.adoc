== Overview

=== Key Performance Indicators

==== Adding Rank of the Cluster centers


=== Technical Background

. *link:https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.2.0/streaming-kafka-0-8-integration.html[Spark / Kafka Integration]*

. *link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#api[Kafka Streaming API]*

.. The *Producer API* allows applications to send streams of data to topics in the Kafka cluster.
.. The *Consumer API* allows applications to read streams of data from topics in the Kafka cluster.
.. The *Streams API* allows transforming streams of data from input topics to output topics.
.. The *Connect API* allows implementing connectors that continually pull from some source system or application into Kafka or push from Kafka into some sink system or application.
.. The *AdminClient* API allows managing and inspecting topics, brokers, and other Kafka objects.

. *link:https://vertx.io/[vert.x]*


=== Architecture
. Data flow:
+
image::images/DataFlowDiagram.png[DataFlow]

.. Uber trip data is published to a Kafka Streams topic (uberrawdatatopic) using the Kafka API.
.. A Spark streaming application subscribes to the uberrawdatatopic and enriches the data with a traffic cluster Id
.. The Spark streaming application pushes the enriched data to a topic called: uberenricheddatatopic.
.. Ingests a stream of uber trip events Identifies the location cluster corresponding to the latitude and longitude of the uber trip Adds the cluster location to the event and publishes the results in JSON format to another topic A Spark streaming application subscribed to the second topic: Analyzes the uber trip location clusters that are popular by date and time.

. Several key assets to review are as follows:

.. *pom.xml*
+
Notice that community Apache Spark and community Scala packages are being utilized.
At this time, Red Hat does not intend to provide supported versions of these packages.

.. *Large Datasets of Uber Data*

... Available in the lab assets at:  `uber-data-analysis/src/main/resources/data/uber.csv`
... It is the raw data from the UberData for NLC which describes the Latitude, Longitude, timestamp and BaseId

.. *UberEnrinchmentDataConsumer.scala*

  ... Consumes the Uber.csv file which is a near-real-time-uber-data and send its to the UberTopic which has already been created in Lab1.
  ... Produces the Enriched UberData with KMeans clusterId which is send to the spark streaming which helps for accurate predictions.
 .. How Integration happening with Spark ?
 ... In Lab1 we create a topic called UberTopic which consumes the Uber.csv file and pushed into the spark-streaming. Please refer the deployment Topology diagram with Uber.csv file.

image::images/oshinko_homepage.png[oshinko_homepage]

.. At this time, the Oshinko web UI is not secured. It is recommended to use Oshinko webui non-secured port.
+
Subsequently, you should be able to access the UI without authenticating and Ensure that OshinkWebUI is up and running. All our Modules will be deployed in the Oshinko cluster.


=== What we did in the Lab2?
In Lab2 we just created a model with the Historical data (Uber.csv), build a training set, Identified the patterns and did a Test Predictions.

In Lab3 we are going to use the Deployed Model and to give accurate predictions.

image::images/picture1.png[recall]

=== Importing of JSON File of different traffic cluster centers
.. In Lab2 we used the model with the Historical Data (uber.csv).
.. In Lab3 we are going to Enrich the data with ClusterId and the output format will be like as shown below.

image::images/uberEnricheddatatopic.png[ubet]

.. Visual representation of the data along with Cluster Centers will be displayed as shown below.

image::images/clusterCenters.png[cc]
.. We are saving this JSON File in our Version Control as cluster.txt file and we would use it for near Real Time Streaming.
.. uber.csv is our sample data which we used in our Lab2. This data is converted into cluster.txt file and it is done in our LocalIDE.

image::images/versioncontrol.png[vc]


==== How it is Handled?
It is handled in *LocalIDE* only, ClusterUber.scala code handles this.
----
//In this Line

model.write.overwrite().save("savemodel")
   // model can be  re-loaded like this
   // val sameModel = KMeansModel.load("/data/savemodel")
   //
   // to save the categories dataframe as json data
   val res = spark.sql("select dt, lat, lon, base, prediction as cid FROM uber order by dt")
   res.write.format("json").save("uber.json")
   res.write.format("txt").save("cluster.txt")
 }
----
.. uber.json file is persisted in a disk and it is stored in our GitHub.
.. It will be used for an Input for Spark Stream Processing.

=== Consumption of Raw Uber Data Record Stream Via a Kafka topic
.. Uber trip data is published to a UberRawData topic using the Kafka API.

image::images/uberrawdatatopic.png[UberRawData]

.. A Spark streaming application subscribed to the UberRawData topic.
Ingests a stream of uber trip events
... Identifies the location cluster corresponding to the latitude and longitude of the uber trip
... Adds the cluster location to the event and publishes the results in JSON format to uberenricheddatatopic
... A Spark streaming application subscribed to the uberEnricheddatatopic topic.
..... Analyzes the uber trip location clusters that are popular by date and time. Enriched Data will look like this below.
Addition of Cluster Center Parameter.

----
{"dt":"2014-08-01 00:04:00","lat":40.7047,"lon":-73.9349,"base":"B02617","cluster":6}
{"dt":"2014-08-01 00:06:00","lat":40.7226,"lon":-74.0034,"base":"B02598","cluster":9}

{"dt":"2014-08-01 00:06:00","lat":40.7672,"lon":-73.953,"base":"B02617","cluster":0}
----
=== Injecting the Data (JSON and Cluster.txt) in PVC.
. Create a configuration map based on the uber.csv data file found in your lab assets:

----
oc set volume dc/oshinko-web \
> --add --overwrite \
> --name=uber-data-volume \
> -t configmap \
> --configmap-name=uber-data-cm \
> -m /data/uber.csv \
> --sub-path=uber.csv \
> --default-mode=0644

----
. Create a configuration map based on the cluster.txt data file found in your lab assets:

=== Ranking - Why it is important?
.. In lab2, we could display the cluster centers in Zeppelin notebooks which shows the ranking. Here the ranking is static, which helps us to learn about the pattern recognition and historical analysis of data.
.. In lab3, we use the ranking which is dynamic helps in calculating the raise in price which is used by the Red Hat Decision Manager.

==== How it is handled?
.. In UberEnrinchmentDataConsumer.scala the following below lines indicate

----
val clust = categories.select($"dt", $"lat", $"lon", $"base", $"prediction".alias("cid")).orderBy($"dt")
 val res = clust.join(ccdf, Seq("cid")).orderBy($"dt")

 // Find the rank of Cluster using the parameters date, lat, lon and baseId and sort them.
 val rank= res.orderBy($"dt",$"lat",$"lon",$"base")
// val rank= clust.join(($"cid"),Seq("cid"))
 res.show
 rank.show
 //OutPut shown here with the cluster parameter in JSON file which is Rank
// {"dt":"2014-08-01 00:04:00","lat":40.7047,"lon":-73.9349,"base":"B02617","cluster":9}
// {"dt":"2014-08-01 00:06:00","lat":40.7226,"lon":-74.0034,"base":"B02598","cluster":6}
// {"dt":"2014-08-01 00:06:00","lat":40.7577,"lon":-73.9619,"base":"B02617","cluster":3}
// {"dt":"2014-08-01 00:06:00","lat":40.7489,"lon":-73.9777,"base":"B02617","cluster":2}
// {"dt":"2014-08-01 00:06:00","lat":40.7672,"lon":-73.953,"base":"B02617","cluster":0}

=== Enrichment of UberRawData
==== Why Data Enrichment is needed?
... In-order to determine on how many pickups occurred in each cluster.
... Which Hours of the day and which cluster had the highest number of pickups.
... In-order to identify the Heatmap Layer for Realtime Dashboard Display.

=== Uber-Heat-Map-analysis
The Vert.x toolkit is event-driven, using an event bus to distribute events to work handler services, called verticles. Vert.x, similar to Node.js, employs a non-blocking model with a single threaded event-loop to handle work. The Vert.x SockJS event bus bridge allows web applications to communicate bi-directionally with the Vert.x event bus using Websockets, which allows you to build real-time web applications with server push functionality.

image::images/Vert.xGeneral.png[Vertx]

==== Deployment diagram
.. A Vert.x Kafka client verticle consumes messages from the Kafka Streams topic and publishes the messages on a Vert.x event bus.
.. A Javascript browser client subscribes to the Vert.x event bus using SockJS and displays the Uber trip locations on a Google Heatmap.

==== OutPut Visualization representation

*The Dashboard Vert.x HTML5 Javascript Client*
The client uses a Google Maps Heatmap Layer to visually depict the intensity of the Uber trip cluster locations on a Manhattan Google map. With the Google Heatmap, areas of higher intensity will be colored red, and areas of lower intensity will appear green. The dashboard app uses Google Maps markers to mark cluster centers.

image::images/Vertx_realtime.png[vr]
.. The messages received from the server application are in JSON format and contain the following for each trip location: the cluster center id, datetime, latitude and longitude for the trip, base for the trip, and latitude and longitude for the cluster center.

An example is shown below:

----
{"cid":18, "dt":"2014-08-01 08:51:00", "lat":40.6858, "lon":-73.9923, "base":"B02682", "clat":40.67462874550765, "clon":-73.98667466026531}

=== ClusterQuota and Limit Range for Zeppelin Interpreter

==== Cluster Quota
A resource quota, defined by a ResourceQuota object, provides constraints that limit aggregate resource consumption per project. It can limit the quantity of objects that can be created in a project by type, as well as the total amount of compute resources and storage that may be consumed by resources in that project.

==== Limit Range
A limit range, defined by a LimitRange object, enumerates compute resource constraints in a project at the pod, container, image, image stream, and persistent volume claim level, and specifies the amount of resources that a pod, container, image, image stream, or persistent volume claim can consume.

All resource create and modification requests are evaluated against each LimitRange object in the project. If the resource violates any of the enumerated constraints, then the resource is rejected. If the resource does not set an explicit value, and if the constraint supports a default value, then the default value is applied to the resource.

By default, all OCP projects are assigned a limit range.  the limit range assigns default limits and requests for both CPU and RAM if the DCs themselves don't specify limits and requests.
The default CPU limit is set to 1/20th of a CPU.  So Spark was running on 1/20th of a CPU.

In general, all of us should always understand the details of LimitRanges assigned to our projects.
And its very likely that we should be adding/tweaking the limits and requests in our DC's.

==== CPU Limits

Each container in a pod can specify the amount of CPU it is limited to use on a node. CPU limits control the maximum amount of CPU that your container may use independent of contention on the node. If a container attempts to exceed the specified limit, the system will throttle the container. This allows the container to have a consistent level of service independent of the number of pods scheduled to the node.

==== Memory Requests
By default, a container is able to consume as much memory on the node as possible. In order to improve placement of pods in the cluster, specify the amount of memory required for a container to run. The scheduler will then take available node memory capacity into account prior to binding your pod to a node. A container is still able to consume as much memory on the node as possible even when specifying a request.

==== Memory Limits
If you specify a memory limit, you can constrain the amount of memory the container can use. For example, if you specify a limit of 200Mi, a container will be limited to using that amount of memory on the node. If the container exceeds the specified memory limit, it will be terminated and potentially restarted dependent upon the container restart policy.

=== Do we need to Know them
The above parameters are managed by the cluster Administrator and Infrastructure team, Hence it is not needed for the students to learn. But a basic concept of Knowing this will help.

*Students are expected to learn this much alone.*
